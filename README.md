# Whatsython Chat

A simple LAN chat application in Python using TCP sockets, allowing multiple users to communicate in a group.

This project was created as a learning exercise to practice working with Python sockets.

## Features

- Real-time chat between multiple users on the same network
- Simple command-line interface
- Works on Windows and Linux/macOS

## Requirements

- Python 3.x

## How to Run

### 1. Start the server

The server listens for incoming connections from clients on a specific port.
If you want it to accept connections from any device in your LAN, you can use:

python chat_server.py PORT

or equivalently:

python chat_server.py 0.0.0.0 PORT

- Replace `PORT` with the port number you want the server to listen on.
- `0.0.0.0` means the server will accept connections from any IP in your LAN.
- You can also leave it as `""` in your code, which behaves the same as `0.0.0.0`.

### 2. Start the client

Each user runs the client to connect to the server:

python chat_client.py NAME HOST PORT

- `NAME` → your username in the chat
- `HOST` → the IP address of the server (e.g., 192.168.1.100)
- `PORT` → the same port used by the server

## Example

Start server:

python chat_server.py 5000

Connect two clients:

python chat_client.py Alice 192.168.1.100 5000
python chat_client.py Bob 192.168.1.100 5000

Now Alice and Bob can chat in real-time.

## Notes

- The server must be running before clients connect.
- Works only on the local network (LAN).
- Press Ctrl+C in the client to exit the chat.
- This project was created for educational purposes to practice Python socket programming.
